    description = """<b>Gustav Mahler</b> (7 July 1860 â€“ 18 May 1911) was an Austro-Bohemian Romantic composer, and one
     of the leading conductors of his generation. As a composer he acted as a bridge between the 19th century 
     Austro-German tradition and the modernism of the early 20th century. While in his lifetime his status as a 
     conductor was established beyond question, his own music gained wide popularity only after periods of relative 
     neglect, which included a ban on its performance in much of Europe during the Nazi era. After 1945 his 
     compositions were rediscovered by a new generation of listeners; Mahler then became one of the most frequently 
     performed and recorded of all composers, a position he has sustained into the 21st century. In 2016, 
     a BBC Music Magazine survey of 151 conductors ranked three of his symphonies in the top ten symphonies of 
     all time."""
